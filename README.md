## Exploiting variational inequalities for generalized change detection on graphs

This repository contains relevant datasets and Python code to implement the methods and reproduce the results presented in our paper titled:

**Exploiting variational inequalities for generalized change detection on graphs.**

We provide a Python Jupyter Notebook demo showcasing unsupervised and semisupervised change detection methods, as well as the main files required to reproduce our experimental results. 

Please note that while I have made the code available, I am still working on refining the documentation and making improvements. If you come across any bugs, have suggestions or questions for enhancements, I would greatly appreciate it if you could contact me at ``jfflorez@udel.edu``. Your feedback is valuable in improving the quality of the code.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the project:

1. Download our GitHub repository

2. Open an Anaconda Prompt (Anaconda3) as administrator, and set the current directory to the path of the project's folder.

3. Create the project's environment `vi_gcd_env` by running the following command:
  ```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```
4. Activate the created environment by running the appropriate command based on your preferred Python IDE or terminal:

  * Jupyter Notebook/Lab: When starting a new notebook, select the `vi_gcd_env` environment from the kernel options.

  * Visual Studio Code (VS Code): After opening your project in VS Code, click on the Python interpreter in the status bar and choose the `vi_gcd_env` environment.
