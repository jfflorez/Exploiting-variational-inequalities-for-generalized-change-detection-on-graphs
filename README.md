## Exploiting variational inequalities for generalized change detection on graphs

This repository contains relevant datasets and Python code to implement the methods and reproduce the results presented in our paper titled:

**Exploiting variational inequalities for generalized change detection on graphs.**

We provide a Python Jupyter Notebook demo showcasing unsupervised and semisupervised change detection methods, as well as the main files required to reproduce our experimental results. Please note that documentation and code refinements are still in progress.

## Installation
## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the project:

1. Download our GitHub repository

2. Open an Anaconda Prompt (Anaconda3) as administrator, and set the current directory to the path of the project's folder.

3. Create the project's environment `vi_gcd_env` by running the following command:
  ```
  conda env create -f environment.yml
  ```

1. Download our github repository 
path\Exploiting-variational-inequalities-for-generalized-change-detection-on-graphs

2. Open an Anaconda Prompt (Anconda3) as administrator, and set the current directory as the 
path to the project's folder

3. To create our project's enviroment vi_gcd_env, simply run
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
4. Activate the created environment by running the appropriate command based on your preferred Python IDE or terminal:

Jupyter Notebook/Lab: When starting a new notebook, select the vi_gcd_env environment from the kernel options.

Visual Studio Code (VS Code): After opening your project in VS Code, click on the Python interpreter in the status bar and choose the vi_gcd_env environment.
