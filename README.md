## Exploiting variational inequalities for generalized change detection on graphs

This repository contains relevant datasets and Python code to implement the methods and reproduce the results presented in our paper titled:

**Exploiting variational inequalities for generalized change detection on graphs.**

We provide a Python Jupyter Notebook demo showcasing unsupervised and semisupervised change detection methods, as well as the main files required to reproduce our experimental results. Please note that documentation and code refinements are still in progress.

## Datasets
